# CPSC-60000-Week-5

This is my Week 5 project.  It is a state based machine running a kiln.

This project uses the State pattern to remove the need to use different functions based on the state of the object.  The state will dictate how the function will work and the user and be presented with a UI that explains it in a way that takes state into account for verbage.
